= OAuth 2.0 Protocols and Patterns

WARNING: The samples in this repo are intended for educational purposes to demonstrate certain features of Spring Security and OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect 1.0.
 *DO NOT* blindly copy/paste code from the samples into production applications.
Please work with your information security team to determine the suitability of using the patterns shown in the samples.

== Run the Sample

* Build the sample -> `./gradlew clean build`
* Run Spring Authorization Server -> `./gradlew -b auth-server/build.gradle bootRun`
** *IMPORTANT:* Make sure to modify your `/etc/hosts` file to avoid problems with session cookie overwrites between `ui-app` and `auth-server`. Simply add the entry `127.0.0.1	auth-server`
* Run UI App -> `./gradlew -b ui-app/build.gradle bootRun`
* Run Microservice A -> `./gradlew -b microservice-a/build.gradle bootRun`
* Run Microservice B -> `./gradlew -b microservice-b/build.gradle bootRun`
* Run Microservice C -> `./gradlew -b microservice-c/build.gradle bootRun`
* Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and login to Spring Authorization Server using *user1/password*
